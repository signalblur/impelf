# ImpELF

ImpELF is a Python-based ELF hashing utility that generates unique fingerprints for ELF binaries using their imported functions and libraries, aiding in malware analysis and similarity detection.

## Installation

First, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, install the `pyelftools` library using pip:

```bash
pip install pyelftools
```

## Usage

Save the ImpELF script from the previous response as a file, e.g., impelf.py.

Run the ImpELF script on an ELF binary:

```
python impelf.py /path/to/your/elf_file
```

The script will output the ImpELF hash for the given ELF binary.
